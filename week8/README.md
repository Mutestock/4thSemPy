I've translated the assignment to english

1. Download the data from the link and save it in a dataframe. Save it in a MySQL database.
2. Make a function which returns a dict containing, as a minimum, the following data:
   a. The amount of crimes between two given dates in 2006(as parametres to the function)
   b. Find the total amount of burglaries in January
3. Make a flask server in which you can open, as a minimum, the following endpoints:
   a. GET: Returns data about the amount of crimes in a given period
   b. POST: Returns the total amount of burglaries in janaury exclusively as data, which request.body contains a json object with {'key' : 'secret}
